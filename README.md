## Drum Sounds
- The top part of the application is designed for drum sounds.

- You can mute the sounds separately from mute buttons.
- The play button on the top left starts playing the sound in the tempo you selected.

- You can see the tempo value on the bottom of the tempo slider.
- You can click in the boxes, the selected boxes are going to choose color and produce a sound when the beat arrives in that specific box.

## Piano Sounds
- The bottom left part of the application is for playing piano sounds.

### Playing Piano with the Mouse or Keyboard
- You can either play the piano with the mouse or keyboard.
- If you want to use your keyboard to play it, you can find the letters or numbers to press the key and produce the sound.

### Reverb Button
- The reverb button works like the right pedal of a piano.
- If you activate the reverb button by clicking, it will turn green and play the sound until the end even if you stop pressing the key.
- Without activating the reverb button, the sound is going to stop after releasing your hand from the key.

### Recording Piano Audio
- When you click the Record button, the button will turn red. This means it started recording the piano sound. You can start pressing the buttons, and when you are done, you can click the Record button again to finish recording your audio. The audio is going to play automatically once for you to hear your record.

### Playing Recorded Audio
- After recording an audio, the Play button will appear. You can play the audio recorded by clicking the play button as many times as you want.

### Trombone Sounds
- Finally, on the bottom right part of the application, you can create trombone sounds. You can use the numbers written on top to play the trombone sound or you can click with the mouse.
